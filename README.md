# Habit Tracker

We all have goals — but building habits that stick is hard.
Habit Tracker is my small attempt to make that easier.
It helps you create, track, and maintain daily habits in a simple and motivating way.
Whether you’re trying to wake up early, study regularly, or just drink more water — this app keeps you on track.

## Features

- ✅ Create & Manage Habits: Add new habits, update them, or delete when needed.
- 🔔 Reminders: Set a specific time so you never forget your daily goals.
- 🔥 Track Your Streak: Stay motivated by seeing your completion history grow.
- 🎯 Category Filters: Easily organize habits by category (Morning, Work, Fitness, etc.).
- 📱 Responsive UI: Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- 🎨 Clean & Modern Design: Simple interface with a soothing color theme.
